EV Analysis Power BI Report

Introduction
This Power BI report, titled "EV Analysis," provides an analysis of electric vehicles (EVs) based on various factors such as location, model year, electric range, and more. The report aims to offer insights into the distribution and characteristics of EVs across different regions.

Data Source
The dataset includes the following columns:

VIN (1-10): The first ten characters of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).
County: The county where the vehicle is registered.
City: The city where the vehicle is registered.
State: The state where the vehicle is registered.
Postal Code: The postal code where the vehicle is registered.
Model Year: The year the vehicle model was manufactured.
Make: The manufacturer of the vehicle.
Model: The model of the vehicle.
Electric Vehicle Type: The type of electric vehicle (e.g., plug-in hybrid, battery electric).
Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility: Indicates whether the vehicle is eligible as a clean alternative fuel vehicle.
Electric Range: The electric range of the vehicle in miles.
Base MSRP: The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the vehicle.
Legislative District: The legislative district associated with the vehicle.
DOL Vehicle ID: The Department of Licensing (DOL) identifier for the vehicle.
Vehicle Location: The location of the vehicle.
Electric Utility: The electric utility provider associated with the vehicle.
2020 Census Tract: The census tract associated with the vehicle's location.


Definitions
BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle): An electric vehicle solely powered by an electric battery pack, producing zero tailpipe emissions and relying entirely on electricity for propulsion. Examples include the Tesla Model S and Nissan Leaf.

PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle): A hybrid vehicle featuring both an internal combustion engine (ICE) and an electric motor with a rechargeable battery. PHEVs can operate in electric-only mode or hybrid mode, offering flexibility and reduced emissions. Examples include the Toyota Prius Prime and BMW i3 REx.

CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) Eligibility: Designation for vehicles meeting criteria as clean alternative fuel vehicles, which may qualify for incentives or benefits. CAFVs contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing emissions. Eligibility criteria vary but generally include electric, hydrogen, natural gas, or propane-powered vehicles.

Sales Trends
Sales of electric vehicles, including both BEVs and PHEVs, have been steadily increasing year by year. This trend reflects growing consumer interest and adoption of cleaner transportation options, driven by environmental concerns and advancements in electric vehicle technology. Most of the BEV Vehicles are CAFV Approved.
